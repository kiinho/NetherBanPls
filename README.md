NetherBanPls
============

Basically NetherBanPlus provides an alternative to straight out banning. Banning can be too harsh sometimes and kicking just isn't effective. So I created NetherBanPlus! NetherBanPlus allows you to ban your players and prevents them from escaping. While banished, players can't use portals and have restrictions based upon what you do in the NetherBan.prop file! NetherBanPlus is flexible, it allows for many configuration options and include (but not limited to) mute on ban or can't build and dying will not spawn them in the normal world while banished.
